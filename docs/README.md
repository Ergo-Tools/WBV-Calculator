## About WBV Calculator
WBV Calculator is a tool to calculate Whole body vibration exposure from small wearable accelerometers according to ISO 2631 standard. We can use this tool to measure whole body vibration exposure according to ISO 2631 standard using wearable accelerometers such as [Axivity AX3](https://axivity.com/product/ax3).
